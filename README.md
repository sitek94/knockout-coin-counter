# Knockout Coin Counter 

## Why?

➡️ The app's core logic and design is based on [TypeScript Practical Migration](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/typescript-practical-migration) course by Steve Ognibene.
In this course he teaches practical techniques for migrating existing projects from JavaScript to TypeScript. 

⌛ However the course was originally released in 2015 so some tools that Steve uses are a little bit outdated by now.

✅ As a form of exercise I have rewritten the app from scratch. Doing that was really nice opportunity to learn something new about:

  * migrating JavaScript (ES5) to TypeScript (ES6+)
  * Webpack
  * Babel
  * Knockout.js
  * JQuery
  * Bootstrap

## Installation

Install packages
```
$ npm install
```
Start webpack dev server
```
$ npm start
```
